# Task 1
## The problem that this airport faces is that there is no clear method to determine its status and instruct the planes accordingly. This can lead to accidents from planes being instructed to land or takeoff when unsafe due to factors such as the runway being occupied or the airport being at capacity which have not been properly tracked.
## By using this software, the airport will be able to keep track of all of these factors; the capacity, the planes at the airport, the planes that are flying and the weather conditions. Doing so will allow the airport to safely decide when to allow planes to land and takeoff.
## The risks of using such a software is that if it happens to go down, all functions of the airport may have to stop, causing delays if not cancellations. Also, problems could arise outside of the softwares control, such as a plane needing to make an emergency landing whilst the airport is already at full capacity. Another risk could be improper use of the software, such as a user attempting to add a plane with a duplicate ID, which could cause the software to crash.
